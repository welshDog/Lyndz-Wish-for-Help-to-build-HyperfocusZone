## ✨ About Me
Hey, I’m Lyndz — aka WelshDog ♾️.  
I grew up hustling: milkboy at 8, paperboy at 10, and Potatoes Bager’, sawmills, pubs, clubs, building Gardens, even running bars plus cutting Trees and grass too. Hard work has always been in my blood.  

But I lost my old career when vibration damage + white finger messed up my hands. Now I can’t go back to that work — so I’ve been rebuilding my life through code, design, and creative chaos.  

I’ve got Dyslexia and AuDHD, which makes the “normal world of work” tough, but it also gives me superpowers for problem solving, creativity, and hyperfocus. That’s what I’ve been pouring into Hyperfocus Zone.

---

## 🚀 The Mission: Hyperfocus Zone
Hyperfocus Zone is my project to build:
- Gamified productivity systems for ADHD & neurodivergent creators.
- AI assistants + Discord bots that turn focus into fun.
- Creative tools + open-source projects that empower people like me.
- A community where being different isn’t a weakness — it’s the blueprint for something legendary.

---

## 🔧 Progress So Far
- Built the ChaosGenius Empire: 18,000+ Python modules, 6,700+ agents, and a living “AI empire.”
- Deployed the BROski♾️ Bot: Discord bot with treasure hunts, BROski$ economy, and gamified features.
- Created the BROSKI MONEY DAY STRATEGY: 890+ AI revenue agents generating $2,450/month automated income.
- Launched Patreon to fund expansion.
- Built security defense systems like the Ultra Freeze Satellite + Fortress Portal.
- Documented everything with legendary-level READMEs.

## 🌍 Why Sponsorship Matters
Right now, I’m grinding hard, but I’ve got no job and high bills. Local jobs don’t fit my skills, and I can’t go back to physical labor.  

Your sponsorship helps me:
- Keep building open-source projects that help neurodivergent people.
- Pay for servers, domains, tools, and living costs.
- Scale the Hyperfocus Zone into something sustainable.
